FFCode - File to image/image to file library

For example usage see: http://approxteam.com:8080/FileEncoder-1.0/

Small library for encoding files to image, and vice versa.



Main target of this project:
Create open source library to encode files as images, make it printable, and scanable by any device with camera.
Imagine where you can print your files on paper.
"Hey can you print me that zipped project?"


Version v0.1 can encode and decode file as image, but it will not work when you print it...
